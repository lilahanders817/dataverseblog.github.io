As a fundamental human right, access to education is essential when it comes to economic and social development yet, student dropout persists in education systems worldwide. In developing countries in particular, the problem is exacerbated by limited resources, socio-cultural barriers, and structural inefficiencies. The paper titled "A Survey of Machine Learning Approaches and Techniques for Student Dropout Prediction" by Neema Mduma, Khamisi Kalegele, and Dina Machuve provides a review of how machine learning has been employed to predict and reduce student dropout.

Student dropout is influenced by academic, economic, social, and psychological factors. The impact of dropping out affects not only individual students but also their families and communities. In countries like Tanzania, for example, dropout rates in secondary schools are alarmingly high, with girls disproportionately affected. Early identification of at-risk students is needed so that interventions can be implemented. Here, the researchers identified where machine learning can be implemented. ML models are capable of analyzing large datasets to discern patterns that human analysts could miss. These models can then be used to predict which students are most likely to drop out.

The authors conducted a survey of literature from 2013 to 2017, drawing from academic journals and conference proceedings. Their findings reveal a strong trend toward the use of supervised learning algorithms in dropout prediction. Techniques such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been widely used. Decision Trees are favored for their interpretability as they allow educators to understand predictions, while ANNs are useful for their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships among the many variables.

In addition to traditional supervised learning methods, the survey also covers more advanced techniques. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have all been used to capture time-based student behaviors in online learning environments. Another approach, survival analysis, incorporates the dimension of time into dropout prediction. This offers insights into not just whether a student will drop out, but when. Techniques like matrix factorization, commonly used in recommender systems, are also applied to model student performance and engagement across various courses.

However, most of these studies rely on data from developed countries (often collected from platforms like Coursera, edX, or Moodle). This creates a gap when applying the same models in low-resource settings, where challenges like distance to school and lack of infrastructure are more pressing. Models built on data from wealthier countries may miss important local factors.

The authors also discuss many limitations with the implementation of ML in the context of combating student dropout rates. First is the lack of quality data in many developing countries, where student records are often not digitized. Second is the issue of data imbalance, where dropouts are a small portion of most datasets, which can skew predictions. Third, many models focus only on early prediction, without ranking students by risk or forecasting future trends.
